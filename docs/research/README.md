# Research Reports

This directory contains research reports generated by the Research Agent during the development process.

## Purpose

Research reports provide authoritative background information, best practices, and architectural guidance for feature development. They inform the specification and planning phases of the development workflow.

## Format

Research reports should:

- Be stored as Markdown files (`.md`)
- Include citations to authoritative sources (official documentation, academic papers, industry standards)
- Summarize key findings with clear recommendations
- Highlight risks, trade-offs, and best practices
- Provide context for decision-making

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that indicate the topic and date:
- `chunking-strategies-2024.md`
- `metadata-enrichment-patterns.md`
- `observability-frameworks.md`

## Example Structure

```markdown
